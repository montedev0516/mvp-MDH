## Conclusion

The integration of supply chain management capabilities into MDH transforms it from a transportation management system into a comprehensive supply chain platform. This integration leverages MDH's existing strengths in fleet management, dispatch operations, and financial tracking while adding powerful new capabilities for supplier management, purchase order processing, and inventory control.

The modular approach ensures that existing MDH functionality remains intact while providing a clear path for gradual enhancement and adoption of supply chain features. The multi-tenant architecture ensures that each organization can manage their supply chain operations independently while maintaining data security and isolation.

This integration positions MDH as a complete solution for organizations that need to manage both their transportation operations and their broader supply chain activities in a unified, efficient, and cost-effective manner.
